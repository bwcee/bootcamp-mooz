- this is what a fully populated klasses collection document looks like. attendance for 2 learners taken for class1 on 27 Jan 2022.

```

# Project Learning Notes

- used a few new techs/ concepts for this project:

  - Server side
    - mongodb/ mongoose
    - socket.io
  - Client side
    - socket.io-client
    - simple-peer
    - Navigator object & `<video>` html element

- very importantly, also learnt we need to ensure we know how to use the tools within the context of our chosen tech stack => in this case MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN)

## mongodb/mongoose

- mongodb is one of several NoSQL (not only SQL) databases
- mongodb is a document database => instead of tables, it has collections, and instead of records, data is stored in what are known as documents. data structured as key-value pairs in documents.
- mongoose is mongodb's Object Data Modelling (ODM) library much like sequelize is SQL's Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool
  <br>

2. official mongodb docs good ref for data modelling -> thinking about relationships between collections
3. official mongoose docs good ref for models and documents and their various methods
4. [Updating Documents in Mongoose](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/update)
   - very useful in drawing distinction between updating mongodb thru documents or models

## socket.io

- socket.io is a library built on top of websockets that allows real time comms between a server and a client. multiple clients can also be connected to the server which allows all connected clients to comms in real time
- socket.io has another package for the client side, socket.io-client. when using react, need to install this as well, so it can be imported and used in react function components.
- for this project, socket.io used as a "signaling server" to exchange signaling data between e various browsers until peer-to-peer connections r established (ref 7 explains why this is needed)
  <br>

2. [Coding with Chaim - React Chat App Using Socket.IO | Socket IO Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4V6nbP_NoQ&t=485s)

   - good ref on using socket.io w react
   - sample code below shows how to set-up a socket server in express root file

   ```
   const express = require("express");
   const http = require("http");
   const app = express();
   const server = http.createServer(app);
   const socket = require("socket.io");
   const io = socket(server);

   io.on("connection", socket => {
     socket.emit("your id", socket.id);
     socket.on("send message", body => {
         io.emit("message", body)
     })
   })



   server.listen(8000, () => console.log("server is running on port 8000"));
   ```

   - truncated code below shows how socket.io-client used in react component

   ```
   import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
   import io from "socket.io-client";
   ...

   const App = () => {
    const [yourID, setYourID] = useState();

    const socketRef = useRef();

    useEffect(() => {
      socketRef.current = io.connect('/');

      socketRef.current.on("your id", id => {
        setYourID(id);
      })

      socketRef.current.on("message", (message) => {
        console.log("here");
        receivedMessage(message);
      })
    }, []);
    ...
   ```

   - good for getting an overall sense of socket.io
4. [Exploring Socket.IO in a React Working Environment](https://betterprogramming.pub/exploring-socket-io-in-react-working-environment-e505bf1c857c)
   - post w super detailed explanations!
5. [Getting started with React, Express, and Socket.io](https://medium.com/@vrinmkansal/getting-started-with-react-express-and-socket-io-658bbd441a9a)
   - useful cos short, sweet, sharp explanation of how to set up socket in react
6. [Socket.IO, React and Node.js: Going Real-Time](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/socket-react/)
   - useful cos talks about closing socket connection when component containing the socket connection is removed frm e DOM
7. [Building a Signaling Server for Simple-Peer](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/building-a-signaling-server-for-simple-peer-f92d754edc85)

## simple-peer

- webrtc is the technology tt allows real time video streaming to take place directly between browsers **without the use of intervening servers** (ref 1). simple-peer is a package tt makes it easier to use webrtc and to allow for real time video streaming between multiple clients
  <br>

   - another potential link to look at wat happens when a call is disconnected

## Navigator object & `<video>` html element

- [Navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator)
  - Navigator is an object tt contains certain properties of a client sys, and has methods to access certain parts of a client sys
  - Navigator.mediaDevices returns a MediaDevices object, which provides access to connected media input devices like cameras and microphones
  - Navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() => has params to specify type of media to request for; returns a promise tt resolves depending on whether user grants permission & whether e client sys can provide e type of media requested; if resolved successfully, a mediaStream object is returned
- [Video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)
  - `<video>` html element and it's attributes
- [srcObject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject)
  - `<video>` generally uses src attribute which is a url/file path in order to gain access to video to play
  - in our case, we haf a mediaStream object returned frm Navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(), so haf to use srcObject instead

# Notes on how we debugged errors:

Error #1: When one user closes the browser, the other users' browsers will display an error called "process is not defined".

- Solution: Reason is because peer.destroy only works when we install "process" i.e. npm i process + add some polyfill code (i dont know what polyfills are either). See https://github.com/feross/simple-peer/issues/611
