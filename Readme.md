We all loved the energy of being part of great classes and workshops - where we leave the session feeling inspired and connected with people. But when teachers tried facilitating online classes ever since the pandemic started, something seemed to be off. Online workshops just didn’t feel as engaging as they used to be when they were in person. 

We used to teach tuition online and we felt handicapped at not being able to manage sessions as easily as we used to - especially if we were the only teacher in the session. 

It’s a struggle because the attention span of students is very short when classes are held online. 

What makes it worse is that we have to try to keep students engaged while:
 - Taking attendance
 - Taking notes on students’ progress, and
 - Conducting activities
 - 
Our focus sometimes ended up being on the tech, not the discussions. 

Enter _**Mooz**_. Think zoom, but optimized for teaching. We want to enable teachers to put their energy into doing what they do best - running high energy sessions that students love. 

We do that by first automating a tedious but key admin task - attendance taking.

If you are signing in as an admin (these could be teachers or school staff), you will see an additional button called "Download attendance" in the lobby. Everytime a student joins the class, he/she will be added to the attendance list automatically. The user with an admin role can choose to download the attendance any time. 

Upon downloading the attendance sheet, you will see a list of all the students and their attendance (denoted by TRUE or FALSE) when class is started and ended.
